Meanings of some Japanese Go Terms
In the West we use a number of Japanese terms for some of the technical concepts involved in playing Go, for historic reasons. Only a few of them are important to know when playing. Some more are listed on our British Go Journal Glossary [1]. Sensei's Library [2] provides more information about these and the Chinese and Korean equivalents.
